<h1>Bounding box algorithms</h1>
This project centers on comparing different methods of finding the minimal bounding box while also analyzing some corner cases that can interfere with them. 
    The focus on the comprehensive comparison is crucial for building a complete research on smallest bounding box algorithms, alongside hybrid approaches, complexity analysis, and applicability in different contexts.
